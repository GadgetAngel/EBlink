To make this work:

- Copy the udev stlink rules and follow the readme inside that folder.

- If used for stm32 debugging, the stm32gdb.sh file uses a path search option and can be used right away after download.  

  Or set environment variable EB_SCRIPT_PATH to the script directory, together with a search path to the binary you can
  invoke EBlink from everywhere.
    
Have fun.
