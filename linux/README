To make this work:

- Copy the udev stlink rules and follow the readme inside that folder.

- If used for stm32 debugging, the stm32gdb.sh file uses a path search option and can be used right away after download.  

  Or set environment variable EB_SCRIPT_PATH to the script directory, together with a search path to the binary you can
  invoke EBlink from everywhere.
  
 Possible environment variables:

EB_SCRIPT_PATH      Will define the path where EBlink can find the scripts 
EB_DEFAULT_PROBE    Will define the default interface [-I] option if not given on cli
EB_DEFAULT_SCRIPT   Will define the default script [-S] file if not given on cli
    
Have fun.
