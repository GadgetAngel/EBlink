Changes (21-12-2019) Release 1.2
- Added: set progress animation type with -a [n], needed for tool integration
    n = 0 (or just -a) -> turn off any progress animation
    n = 1 -> Animated cursor (default animation type)
    n > 1 -> Dotted progress with n*10ms resolution, so -a 10 = 100ms between dots.

Changes (8-12-2019) Version 1.1
- Added: Possibility to define multiple script file -D stm32auto,my_reset
- Added: Script uses default .script unless an extension is given

Changes (5-12-2019) rc19.12-1
- Added: STM32G0x & STM32G4x fast programming (options not ready)
- Added: Interface speed query script function
- Mod:   STM32H7x flashing directly

Changes (28-11-2019) rc19.11-8
- Added: option bytes programming stm32h7. By using a virtual sector #999 of 32bytes, the option bytes can be defined inside GCC and are also stored inside ihex, srec or elf files. So production cli flashing will also program the option bytes. (See doc folder)
- Bug fix: Sector numbering passing to flash write function.

- New script interfaceApi function "resetCtrl(bool)" which controls the NRST line directly
