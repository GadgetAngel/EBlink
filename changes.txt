Changes (21-12-2019) Release 1.2
- Added: set progress animation type with -a [n], needed for tool integration
    n = 0 (or just -a) -> turn off any progress animation
    n = 1 -> Animated cursor (default animation type)
    n > 1 -> Dotted progress with n*10ms resolution, so -a 10 = 100ms between dots.

- Added: Interface speed query script function
- Mod:   STM32H7x flashing directly

Changes (28-11-2019) rc19.11-8
- Added: option bytes programming stm32h7. By using a virtual sector #999 of 32bytes, the option bytes can be defined inside GCC and are also stored inside ihex, srec or elf files. So production cli flashing will also program the option bytes. (See doc folder)
